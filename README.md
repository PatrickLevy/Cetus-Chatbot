# Cetus-Chatbot

## Welcome to Cetus the Chatbot
- Cetus will eventually be deployed to a cloud server
- You will eventually be able to talk to Cetus by typing in text to either a web or console application
- Cetus will respond to your text using an amazing AI module

## How to Run 
#### To Run Everything Locally Without the API Service (for development purposes)
1. Clone repo
2. Run the local version of Cetus the Chatbot ```$ ./Cetus_Local.py```

Note: Right now Cetus doesn't say too much, but come back later and maybe he'll have a lot more on his mind!
