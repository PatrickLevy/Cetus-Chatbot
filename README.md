# Cetus-Chatbot

## Welcome to Cetus the Chatbot
- Cetus will eventually be deployed to a cloud server
- You will eventually be able to talk to Cetus by typing in text to either a web or console application
- Cetus will respond to your text using an amazing AI module

## How to Run 
#### To Run Everything Locally Without the API Service (for development purposes)
1. Clone repo (see next section for help)
2. Run the local version of Cetus the Chatbot ```$ ./Cetus_Local.py```

Note: Right now Cetus doesn't say too much, but come back later and maybe he'll have a lot more on his mind!

## Development
#### If you would like to just clone this repo directly (easier)
1. Go to a terminal and type ```git clone https://github.com/PatrickLevy/Cetus-Chatbot.git```. This will create a new folder called ```Cetus-Chatbot```.
2. CD into the the project folder and you are ready to start running/developing the program
3. To push code you can do something like this ```git push origin mySuperCoolBranch```

#### If you would like to fork the repo and have your own copy of it (more complicated)
1. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand corner. Select your own GitHub profile as the destination.
2. Go to your own GitHub profile and find the forked repo. Find the green button that says "Clone or Download".
3. Copy the URL after you click the green button (you will use it in the next step)
4. Go to a terminal and type ```git clone https://github.com/YourProfileName/Cetus-Chatbot.git```
5. Add the original repo as an upstream remote ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/PatrickLevy/Cetus-Chatbot.git```
6. To push code you can either push it to your own fork: ```git push origin mySuperCoolBranch``` or you can push it into the upstream repo directly ```git push upstream mySuperCoolBranch```
